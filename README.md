# PyCalc-Basic
Simple Python Calculator. Designed to run on Windows, but can also run on Linux and OS X.

### Update: 
> If you're wondering why there's a 4 year gap in commits for this project, this project was made by me about 4 years ago (as of writing). It was one of my 1st Github releases when I was learning Python and Tkinter. It's nothing special, but it's a milestone for me back when I was around 12. I made a commit to this Github recently as I was going through my repos and cleaning things up (you can probably guess that my 12 year old self made messy Github repos). I wanted to make a package for any future viewers as well, and I found a bug in the code that has been overlooked for 4 years. Anyways, I hope this project is of some use for you if you are learning or looking at my Github.

## Functions:
- Can do basic math
- Can do square roots and squaring
- Can do percents
- Can do parentheses.
